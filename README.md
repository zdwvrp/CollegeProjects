This is a collection of projects I worked on during my studies at the University of Missouri-Columbia.

**Important Notes: **
  - Game Development: All Unity Projects contain only code from their respective Assets file, which accounts for all original code written for each project. This is due to each project being too large to add to github in full.
  - Senior Capstone Project: Contains only code for the frontend of the application.
